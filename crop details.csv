rice,"Rice is the basic food crop and being a tropical plant, it flourishes comfortably in a hot and humid climate. Rice is mainly grown in rain-fed areas that receive heavy annual rainfall.",rice.jpeg
maize," Maize is traditionally grown in monsoon (Kharif) season, which is accompanied by high temperature (<35° C) and rainfall. Globally, maize is known as queen of cereals because it has the highest genetic yield potential among the cereals.",maize.jpeg

cotton ,"Cotton is a Kharif crop in the major parts of the country viz. Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra and parts of Andhra Pradesh & Karnataka. In these areas, the irrigated crop is sown from March-May and the rain fed crop in June-July with the commencement of the monsoon.  It prefers warm and humid climate. Cotton seeds will have a small germination rate, if the soil temperature is below 60°F (15°C). During active growth, the ideal air temperature is 70 to 100°F (21-37°C).",cotton.jpeg
jute,"Jute is a bast fibre crop and can be harvested at any stage after a certain period of vegetative growth, usually between 100 to 150 days. It requires high temperature varying from 24°C to 35°C and heavy rainfall of 120 to 150 cm with 80 to 90 per cent relative humidity during the period of its growth Small amount of pre-monsoon rainfall varying from 25 cm to 55 cm is very useful because it helps in the proper growth of the plant till the arrival of the proper monsoon.

mothbeans,"Vigna aconitifolia is a drought-resistant legume, commonly grown in arid and semi-arid regions of India. It is commonly called mat bean, moth bean, matki or dew bean. The pods, sprouts and protein-rich seeds of this crop are commonly consumed in India. Moth bean can be grown on many soil types, and can also act as a pasture legume.Moth bean, a short-day crop, is one of the most drought-resistant pulses in India. Grown at altitudes up to 1300 m above sea level, it has a wide pH range (3.5–10) and can tolerate slight salinity. While dry sandy soil is most suitable for production, moth bean can tolerate a variety of soil types. The low-lying soil cover the crop creates helps prevent soil erosion by preventing moisture loss.",mothbeans.jpg
blackgram,"Black gram (Vigna Mungo L.), is one of the important pulses crop, grown throughout the country. The crop is resistant to adverse climatic conditions and improve the soil fertility by fixing atmospheric nitrogen in the soil. It has been reported that the crop produces equivalent to 22.10 kg of N/ha., which has been estimated to be supplement of 59 thousand tonnes of urea annually. The pulse 'Black gram' plays an important role in Indian diet, as it contains vegetable protein and supplement to cereal based diet. It contains about 26% protein, which is almost three times that of cereals and other minerals and vitamins. Besides, it is also used as nutritive fodder, specially for milch animals. Black gram is a tropical crop & it requires hot & humid climate. Heavy rains during flowering stage are harmful to the crop as it adversely affects the production of the crop. Deep loamy & light textured with good water drainage system is suitable for its cultivation. It should not be grown in high waterlogged areas.",blackgram.jpg
lentil,"The lentil (Lens culinaris or Lens esculenta) is an edible legume. It is an annual plant known for its lens-shaped seeds. It is about 40 cm (16 in) tall, and the seeds grow in pods, usually with two seeds in each. As a food crop, the majority of world production comes from Canada (33%) and India (25%), producing 58% combined of the world total.

In cuisines of the Indian subcontinent, where lentils are a staple, split lentils (often with their hulls removed) known as daal are often cooked into a thick curry/gravy that is usually eaten with rice or rotis.",lentil.jpeg
pomegranate,"Somewhat drought tolerant, a pomegranate tree is perfect for the sunniest and warmest locations in the yard that might scorch other plants. Young trees should be planted in the spring after any danger of late frost has passed. They usually take two to three years to bear fruit. Pomegranate grows well under semi-arid conditions and can be grown upto an altitude of 500 m. above m.s.l.. It thrives well under hot, dry summer and cold winter provided irrigation facilities are available. The tree requires hot and dry climate during fruit development and ripening. Pomegranate tree is deciduous in areas of low winter temperature and an evergreen or partially deciduous in tropical and sub-tropical conditions. It can tolerate frost to a considerable extent in dormant stage, but is injured at temperature below - 11Degree C.",pomegranate.jpeg
banana,"The banana is commonly propagated by suckers and sword suckers with narrow leaves. Rhizomes whole or in bits from fruited and non-fruited plants with atleast one sound bud can be successfully used as propagating material. Planting: Planting of banana is done by two methods viz. Pit method and furrow method. Alluvial and volcanic soils are the best for banana cultivation. Banana is grown in India on a variety of soils such as the heavy clay soil of the Cauvery delta, alluvial soils of the Gangetic delta, black loam in Maharashtra, coastal sandy loams and the red lateritic soil of the hilly tracts of Kerala.",banana.jpeg

Raw fruits are used for making chutney, pickles, and juices. The ripe fruits besides being used for dessert are also utilized for preparing several products like squashes, syrups, nectar, jams, and jellies. The mango kernel also contains 8-10 percent good quality fat which can be used for soap and also as a substitute for cola in confectionery.",mango.jpeg

It can be grown at an altitude of 1500- 2700 m above the sea level.",apple.jpg
orange,"Orange orchards are generally planted in relatively deep soil where drainage is good. The orange trees are usually budded on stocks grown from the seed of selected trees. The seeds are sown in well-prepared soil in a lath house; after about 12 months' growth there, the seedlings are removed to a nursery. A dry climate with about 50-75 cm of rainfall from June-September and with well defined summer and winter season is ideal. Sweet orange can be grown even upto an elevation of 900 m above mean sea level. The extreme of temperature are necessary for achieving higher yield.",orange.jpg
papaya,"Papaya cultivation had its origin in South Mexico and Costa Rica. Papaya is a popular fruit famous for its high nutritive and medicinal values. It comes early in bearing than any other fruit crop, produces fruits in less than a year and the production of fruits is quite high per unit area.
